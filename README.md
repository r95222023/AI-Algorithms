# AI Algorithms

This repository showcases a collection of AI practice projects that demonstrate the implementation of various artificial intelligence systems and algorithms. These projects are intended to serve as study materials and reference guides for understanding different AI techniques. For detailed information on each algorithm, please refer to the README file in the corresponding folder.

## Contents

- **Search Algorithms**:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores nodes level by level, starting with the shallowest.
  - **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**: Combines the depth-first search's space efficiency with the breadth-first search's completeness.
  - **A* Search**: Finds the shortest path in a graph more efficiently using heuristics.
  - **Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)**: An optimized version of A* that reduces memory usage by iteratively deepening the search.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
  - **Decision Tree**: A supervised learning technique for classification and regression that models decisions and their potential outcomes.

- **Deep Learning Algorithms**:
  - **Multi-Layer Neural Network**: A basic neural network with a customizable number of hidden layers.
  - **Convolutional Neural Network**: A convolutional network with convolutional and pooling layers, implemented using NumPy.
  - **ResNet50**: Implements the ResNet50 architecture, a deep convolutional neural network known for effectively training very deep networks using residual connections.
  - **U-Net**: A convolutional neural network model for fast and precise image segmentation, implemented with TensorFlow and Keras.
  - **RNN and LSTM**: Implementations of basic Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells.
  - **Transformer**: A TensorFlow-based implementation of the Transformer model, as introduced in the paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al.

- **Markov Decision Processes (MDP)**:
