# AI Practice Projects


This repository presents a collection of AI practice projects created as a byproduct of the learning process, demonstrating the implementation of various artificial intelligence systems and algorithms. These projects are designed to serve as study materials and reference guides for understanding different AI techniques. For more details on each algorithm, please refer to the README file in the corresponding folder.

## Contents

- **Search Algorithms**:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores the shallowest nodes in a graph first.
  - **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**: Combines the space-efficiency of Depth-First Search (DFS) with the completeness of BFS.
  - **A* Search**: Uses heuristics to find the shortest path in a graph more efficiently.
  - **Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)**: An optimization of A* that uses less memory by iteratively deepening the search.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
  - **Decision Tree**: A supervised learning method used for classification and regression, which models decisions and their possible consequences.

- **Markov Decision Processes (MDP)**:
  - Implements algorithms like value iteration and policy iteration for decision-making in stochastic environments.
