## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

## Usage

To use the ResNet50 model, you can import it and create an instance of the model with your desired input shape and number of classes.

```python
from resnet import ResNet50

# Define the model
model = ResNet50(input_shape=(64, 64, 3), classes=6)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Summary of the model
model.summary()
```

## Functions

### `identity_block`

The identity block is a standard component of the ResNet architecture. It preserves the input dimensions and adds a shortcut connection to skip certain layers, which helps in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.

**Arguments:**
- `X` - Input tensor of shape (m, n_H_prev, n_W_prev, n_C_prev)
- `f` - Integer specifying the shape of the middle convolutional layer's window
- `filters` - List of integers, defining the number of filters in the convolutional layers of the main path
- `initializer` - Initializer for the kernel weights matrix, set to random uniform by default

**Returns:**
- Output tensor of the same shape as the input

### `convolutional_block`

The convolutional block is another key component of the ResNet architecture. Unlike the identity block, it changes the dimensions of the input tensor, which is necessary for downsampling.

**Arguments:**
- `X` - Input tensor of shape (m, n_H_prev, n_W_prev, n_C_prev)
- `f` - Integer specifying the shape of the middle convolutional layer's window
- `filters` - List of integers, defining the number of filters in the convolutional layers of the main path
- `s` - Integer, specifying the stride to be used
- `initializer` - Initializer for the kernel weights matrix, set to Glorot uniform by default

**Returns:**
- Output tensor of the modified shape

### `ResNet50`

This function defines the overall architecture of the ResNet50 model, composed of multiple identity and convolutional blocks.

**Arguments:**
- `input_shape` - Shape of the images in the dataset
- `classes` - Integer, number of classes for the classification task

**Returns:**
- Keras `Model` instance representing the ResNet50 architecture

## Example

To train the ResNet50 model on your dataset, prepare your data, compile the model, and fit it to your training data.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()

# Preprocess the data
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)

# Define the model
model = ResNet50(input_shape=(32, 32, 3), classes=10)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
```
